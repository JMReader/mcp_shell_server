# mcp_shell_server
 An MCP server capable of executing any terminal command securely and efficiently
# MCP Shell Server - Udemy Course Project

This repository contains the final project developed during the Udemy course: **"Build, Connect, Deploy: Master MCP Servers, MCP Clients, Tools & Resources for Powerful LLM Applications"**.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The project demonstrates a fully functional **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that enables the execution of arbitrary shell commands from connected clients. The purpose of this server is to provide a secure and flexible interface between language models and the underlying operating system through shell access.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Shell Command Execution**: Supports dynamic execution of any shell command via a structured MCP interface.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows (via CMD or PowerShell).
- **Resource Exposure**: Provides useful system-level information such as platform, hostname, shell path, and environment details.
- **Secure Execution**: Implements safeguards like command restrictions, output length limits, and execution timeouts.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily embedded in larger AI agent systems or connected with popular MCP clients.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- Python
- MCP Protocol
- Shell/Terminal Interfaces
